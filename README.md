This project was my first project at Unity. Textures for platforms are taken from the Unity assets store.
The game includes both movable and fixed platforms where coins are located. The player, moving forward and jumping, must collect these coins.
The score is visible all the time on the left side of the screen. When the player reaches the last platform, the message "You Win" pops up.
If the player falls off the platform, the game starts over, but the coins already collected are not returned to the game.
